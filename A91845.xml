         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE SECOND PART OF THE VANITY &amp; CHILDISHNES OF INFANTS BAPTISME.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving formerly Treated of the Baptiſme of the Nationall Church, I have now thought it meet likewiſe to conſider the grounds upon which the Separated, and ſome other Churches, doe Baptiſe their Infants, which are from ſeverall places of Scripture, eſpecially theſe five, which I will examine in order.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that in the <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 39. where it is ſaid, <hi>The promiſe is to you and your Children:</hi> which Text, although it be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the point, and ſo confeſſed by the ingenuous, yet becauſe many inconſideratly do ſtill alledge it, I ſhall for their ſakes ſhew their great weakneſſe in their thus reaſoning thence: If the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes be made to us and our Children, then the Seales of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwere, it is not there ſaid of Infants, but to your Children; not promiſes, but promiſe: it is therfore worthy inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to finde out, what is there meant, <hi>by you and your Children;</hi> in both theſe we ſhall be ſatisfied if we looke back into the former part of the Chap. where when the gifts of the holy Ghoſt were given forth upon the 120. and they ſpeaking in divers tongues, and the Jewes thereupon ſome marvailing, ſome mocking, and ſaying, that they were <hi>full of New wine,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>Peter</hi> hereupon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155281:3"/>
ſtands up and ſpeakes to theſe Jewes thus, <hi>Theſe men are not drunke as yee ſuppoſe, but this is that which is ſpoken by the Prophet</hi> Joel, <hi>that in the laſt day</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will powre out my Spirit upon all fleſh, and your Sonnes and Daughters ſhall Prophecy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. 16, 17. And immediatly when he had thus ſpoken, he preached unto them <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> whom they had murthered, and whom though dead and buried, yet <hi>God had raiſed up, and who being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of his Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt had ſhed forth, this which they then did ſee and heare:</hi> ver. 33. As if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſhould have ſaid to the Jewes thus, we are not filled with wine as yee ſuppoſe but are fil'd with the Spirit. promiſed to our Fathers long ſince, that ſhould be poured forth in theſe our daies; And that their Sonnes and their Daughters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; which is now fulfilled upon us their Sonnes and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and may be alſo poured out upon you and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to make you all Prophecy and ſpeake with tongues as we do for you and your Children are all the Sonnes and Daughters of the Jewes our Forefathers, to whom this Prophecy was ſpoken, aſwell as any of us: If you <hi>repent and be Baptized every one of you, in the name of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Lord Ieſus</hi> (whom you have crucified) <hi>for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nne,</hi> notwithſtanding your dealing ſo wickedly with him and moreover <hi>yee ſhall alſo receive the gift of the</hi> Holy Ghoſt, <hi>for the promiſe is to you and to your Children,</hi> aſwell as unto us, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. 39. So then by this time we may ſee what is meant by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (to wit) <hi>The gift of the holy ghoſt, mentioned in the</hi> 17. ver. to be prophecyed of by <hi>Ioel,</hi> and in the 33 verſe, to <hi>be received of the Father, and to be ſhed forth by Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and alſo recited in the 38 <hi>ver.</hi> (thus) <hi>And yee ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt, for the promiſe is to you and your Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And likewiſe we may ſee who are meant <hi>by you and your Children,</hi> to wit, the very ſame which are mentioned in the 17 <hi>ver.</hi> under the termes <hi>of Sonnes and Daugheers that ſhould Prophecy,</hi> therefore no Infants are meant in this place, nor is there ſo much as any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for the Baptizing of Infants from hence, for the text is not, be Baptized, for the promiſe is to you and to your Children, (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Print do falſely alledge) But <hi>repent and be Baptized,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and yee ſhall receive the gift of the</hi> Holy Ghoſt, <hi>for the promiſe is to you and to your Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If they ſay, then ſurely theſe Children were in the Covenant, ſeeing the promiſe is ſaid ſo plainly to be to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwere, that this objection hath no colour of footing in the Text (as appeareth by that which is already ſaid
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155281:3"/>
thereto) yet nevertheleſſe I will further demonſtrate the ſame by theſe reaſons. Firſt, The Promiſe is made equally to them and to their Children; and to them that are a farre off. But theſe which are a far off, are not within the Covenant by the promiſe untill they beleeve the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If they were in the Covenant by having this promiſe made to them, then were they of the New Covenant and Church of the Goſpell, for there were no other people to be accounted in Covenant with God, ſave thoſe which be of this Church, but thoſe were not of this Church, but they were afterwards added thereunto (as appeares ver. 41. and therefore were not of it before, and conſequently, notwithſtanding the Promiſe, being ſo to them and their Children, yet neither <hi>they</hi> nor <hi>their Children</hi> were of the Covenant nor Church untill they did beleeve, al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hough they were Jewes, and ſo the children of faithfull <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their ſecond Argument is from thoſe places which ſpeake of Baptizing whole Houſeholds, for (ſay they) there may be Infants in the Houſehold; thence they conclude, that Infants may be Baptized.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwere, that there might be no Infants there; and my negative is as good as their affirmative, without any proofe, and more probable, for it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 8. <hi>That Criſpus the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, beleeved on the Lord, with all his Houſehold, and that many of the Corinthians hearing it, beleeved and were Baptized.</hi> And it is ſaid of the Goaler, <hi>who was Baptized and all his,</hi> Act. 16. 32. That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> firſt <hi>preached the word of the Lord to them, and to all that were in his Houſe.</hi> And in the 33 ver. it is ſaid, <hi>that he and all his were Baptized,</hi> and in the 34 <hi>ver.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>that hee with all his Houſehold beleeved in God:</hi> So then it is plaine, that they firſt beleeved, and then were Baptized; and although it be barely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Pauls Baptizing the Houſehold of Stephanus,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 16. And of the <hi>Baptizing of Lydia and her Houſehold,</hi> Act. 16. 15. Yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be imagined, but that he did Baptize theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Commiſſion, and as he did Baptize the Jaylour and his houſe, which was firſt preaching to them, and bringing him and all his houſe to the faith, as is evident by the Text, and thoſe other places which are more ſilent, muſt be expounded and underſtood by this which is more plaine, and not this by thoſe.</p>
            <p>A third Argument of theirs is from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. where it is ſaid, <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>elſe were your Children uncleane, but now are they holy.</hi> whence they thus reaſon, If the Children of beleeving Parents be holy, (that is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155281:4"/>
to ſay, in the Covenant) then may they have the Seales of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and be Baptized.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwere, that there is now but one Covenant on foote which is a Covenant of Grace and ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13. &amp; 10. 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is but one manner of entring and being in that Covenant, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. 5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is but one holyneſſe now acceptable with God, which is inward, ſpirituall and in truth, without which no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obedience or conformity to any Ordinance or worſhip of the Goſpell is warrantable or acceptable, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 23 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
            <p>Hence then it will follow, that if Beleevers children be in the covenant, and have this true holineſſe, then all the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Parents muſt be ſaved, aſwell old children as young, for age doth not make them ceaſe from being children to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but all the children of beleevers are not ſaved, no not of faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe, for thouſands of them periſhed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that knowne ſentence of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 21. repeated by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 9. 27. <hi>Though the number of the Children of</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>be as the Sand of the Sea, yet but a remnant of them ſhall be ſaved:</hi> therefore the children of beleevers are not in the covenant now on foote, nor ought to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> They further object and ſay, <hi>Notwithſtanding all this, yet why may they not be in the Covenant outwardly, having federall holineſſe, and in that ſenſe holy, ſo to be admitted now to the outward Ordinance of Baptiſme, as Infants were then to Circumciſion in time of the Law, and State of the</hi> Jewes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwere, that the State or church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> were under the old covenant and Law, and ſtood not by Faith and circumciſion of heart, (as this church of the Goſpell doth) but ſtood meerely upon nature and circumciſion of the fleſh, and accordingly had their outward or federall holineſſe, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cleanſings, all which are aboliſhed with that State, and no ſuch holineſſe or diſtinction is now betweene any perſons in the world, as ſhall be further declared by and by.</p>
            <p>There being now the New covenant only on foote, which is a covenant of Grace and Salvation, and which brings certaine ſalvation to all thoſe that rightly enter into it, and which is only by Faith. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 47. That <hi>the Lord added to the church daily, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> And that the holineſſe of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155281:4"/>
here, is not meant of any holineſſe in relation to any Church Covenant, will further appeare by theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that which is an effect of Regeneration, is not brought to paſſe by Generation (though the Parents be holy) But to be of the Covenant or Kingdome is the proper effect of Regeneration, Joh. 3. 3. <hi>without which none can ſee it</hi> (much leſſe be of it) or enter into it; Therefore it cannot be brought to paſſe by Generation, though the Parents are holy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, contradictions cannot be the effect of one and the ſelfe ſame Covenant, in one and the ſelfe ſame reſpect; but for one Parent to be a beleever, that is of the Church, when the other Parent is not, to produce a holy ſeed (that is) in the Covenant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. And for the other Parents to be one a <hi>Iew,</hi> and the other a <hi>Babylonian;</hi> the one a member of the Church, the other not; to produce an unholy ſeed (that is) out of the Covenant, and <hi>to be put away, both wife and all borne by her,</hi> as <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10 3. is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in one and the ſelfe ſame reſpect; therefore it cannot be the effect of one and the ſelfe ſame Covenant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It appeares from the Jewes Church State, from whence this ſucceſſive holineſſe and being in the Covenant is concluded to come: the <hi>Proſelyte</hi> that was to be brought in, was <hi>to Circumciſe all his Males,</hi> Exo. 12. 48. where we may conclude, that his Females were included in that time in the Males, there being no other Ordinance of admiſſion for them: whence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that if the <hi>Iewes Church</hi> State (from whence I ſay this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of being in the <hi>Covenant</hi> is derived) doth not admit in any conſideration of any lawfull being of Parents, the one a member of the <hi>Church,</hi> the other not to produce a ſeed within the old <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> that then ſuch a thing under the New <hi>Covenant,</hi> cannot be concluded to proceed from that rule, but the former is true from the ground before laid, therefore the latter is alſo true; and if not from that rule then from none: But not from that by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the former Argument, therefore from none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> They yet ſay, <hi>they are here termed holy, and are ſo to bee eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwere, that ſo were the unbeleeving <hi>Iewes,</hi> when they were broken off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. and ſo is the unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wiſe in this place, yet neither of theſe are to be Baptized for their being termed holy, and therefore not children, for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here termed holy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> They further ſay, <hi>Then what holineſſe is here meant to the Children?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:155281:5"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwere, not that holineſſe that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Faith: and ſuch holineſſe only is availeable to the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the State of the Goſpell, and to have right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
            <p>True it is, that in time of the Law, and State of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and old <hi>Covenant,</hi> there were ſome federally and outwardly holy, and outwardly uncleane, and then all men, yea all things in the world were diſtinguiſhed by this kinde of holineſſe: So the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed were then unholy, and they of the circumciſion holy, and might not accompany with the other, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 3. and accordingly had they their outward waſhings and purifications, for theſe their outward pollutions: all which were but Typicall things, and all theſe, and ſuch like diſtinctions are now aboliſhed with that State, and quite taken away out of the world by the coming of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and this is evident by <hi>Peters</hi> Viſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by himſelfe in the 28. <hi>ver.</hi> where he ſaith, That <hi>God had ſhewed him, that he ſhould not call any man polluted or uncleane,</hi> whence it is cleare, that now all men in the world are as cleane as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and thoſe as polluted in the Goſpell ſenſe as any other; for now <hi>all are as one and alike in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> as may appeare by theſe Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>Collo.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Gala.</hi> 3. 28 &amp; 5, 6. And as none then without this legall and outward holineſſe ought to partake of thoſe legall performances and worſhip, nor be admitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto without being firſt circumciſed in the fleſh, and ſo made legally holy, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12. 48. So now none are acceptable or ought to partake of the Goſpell, worſhip and Ordinances, without the <hi>Circumciſion of Chriſt, which is of the heart and Spirit: Col.</hi> 2. 11. Rom. 2. 28. 29. And this inward Spirituall truth was Typified by that outward fleſhly ſhaddow: Hence therefore I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Apoſtle meant no ſuch kinde of holineſſe in this place, for the beleevers children to have. Nor is there any ſuch kinde of holineſſe now in the world amongſt men, nor is this or any other kinde of holineſſe (ſave only that true holineſſe that accompanies the new creature) avaylable to Baptiſme.</p>

            <p>Concerning the time when Infants Baptiſme was firſt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Luther</hi> in his Booke of <hi>Anabaptiſme</hi> acknowledgeth, that <hi>it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved, by Sacred Scripture, that childrens Baptiſme was inſtituted by Chriſt, or begun by the firſt Chriſtians after the</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>for one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares ſince it came to be in uſe in the church, and was eſtabliſhed by Pope</hi> Innocentius.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Caſſander</hi> in his Booke <hi>de Infantium Baptiſmo,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That it came to be uſed by the Fathers which lived three hundred yeares after Chriſt and his</hi> Apoſtles. The end for which the Baptiſme of Infants was thruſt upon the world, is ſeene <hi>In Tuicenſis de divinis Officijs Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. In times paſt the children in the <hi>Churcb</hi> were through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole yeare inſtructed in the word, and at the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> to repeate their Faith which they were to make confeſſion of at their Baptiſme: But that Chriſtendome might increaſe and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:155281:6"/>
               <hi>be filled with the word of God</hi> (this was the colour and pretence under which it was foiſted in, like as all other <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> deviſes have their cloaks and holy pretences,) <hi>The Church hath thought good for mortalities ſake, that the Children of</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſhould be timely bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this Author, <hi>Iohannes Bohemius, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Gentium Moribus,</hi> doth ſome what agree, when he ſaith, <hi>That in times paſt it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to Adminiſter Baptiſme alone, to thoſe that were inſtructed in the Faith, and ſeaven times in the weeke before</hi> Eaſter <hi>and</hi> Pentecoſt <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or asked Queſtions, and then upon confeſſion of their faith were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: But afterwards when it was thought and adjudged needfull to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life to be Baptized,</hi> (marke how one error uſhered in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>it was ordained that new borne Children ſhould be Baptized and that Godfathers or Sureties were appointed who ſhould make confeſſion of their Faith, and renounce the Devill in their behalfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with this accords the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before Baptiſme in the Book of Common Prayer, which ſaith, that the Sacrament of Baptiſme in old time was not commonly adminiſtred, but at two times in the yeare, at <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> at which time it was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adminiſtred in the preſence of all the <hi>Congregation, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now to the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> What is meant by the holineſſe which Children are ſaid to have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. In Anſwer wherero I ſhall ſhew onely what I conceive it to be, and then leave it to the Judgements of the wiſe.</p>
            <p>I ſay then it is only ſuch a holineſſe as is oppoſite to ſome kinde of uncleaneſſe, which I take to be this, as if when they are ſaid <hi>to be holy</hi> it is no more then to ſay, they are not uncleane, (to wit) <hi>no Baſtards,</hi> And I will ſhew my ground by my thus opening the text.</p>
            <p>The believing <hi>Corinthians</hi> both men and women, married and ſingle, do joyne in a Letter to the Apoſtle for reſolution of many of their doubts touching their Severall conditions, this appeares in the firſt <hi>verſe,</hi> and thence to the 12 and their doubts in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and which he anſwers in the five <hi>verſes</hi> following, ſeemes to be this in effect as if they ſhould thus write; wee being borne a new, and made the Sonnes and Daughters of God by Faith in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and being made holy by his ſpirit, and taken into Communion and fellowſhip with <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Saints</hi> in light from an eſtate of darkeneſſe and death, from being <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and Children of the <hi>Devill,</hi> have very uncomfortable cohabitation and fellowſhip with our wives and husbands, remaining ſtill in their naturall and blind condition, ſo farre different from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:155281:7"/>
into which we are now brought: Surely our holy God that bids us touch no uncleane thing doth not allow us thus to do: And wee feare leaſt wee have done very ill in continuing thus ſo long, for our Marriage wee cannot thinke but it was diſſolved when wee firſt beleeved: And wee ought then to have put away our wives as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did their ſtrange wives; And unto this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle begins his anſwer in the 12. <hi>verſe</hi> thus, <hi>And unto the reſt</hi> (to wit of your doubts) <hi>ſpeake I, not the Lord, If any Brother have a wife that beleeveth not, if ſhe be content to dwell with him, let him not put her away, And the woman that hath a husband that beleeveth not, if he be pleaſed to dwell with her, let her not leave him: for the unbeleeving husband is ſanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified to the wife, and the unbeleeving wife is ſanctified to the beleeving hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, elſe were your Children uncleane, but now they are holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid to them thus, you <hi>Corinthians</hi> do doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of your cohabitation with your unbeleeving married yoke-mates, of which there is no cauſe, for to the pure all things are pure (that is, all lawfull things) (namely whatſoever is lawfull in nature or civill uſe) is ſanctified to the beleever, and yet even thoſe things are impure to the impure, or unbeleeving, for even their mindes and conſciences are defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. But to the Beleever all things are pure, (that is as I have already ſaid) all lawfull things, for things that are unlawfull in themſelves cannot be ſanctified by the faith of a true Beleever, no not to his uſe; but muſt be left and abhorred as ſinfull and wicked, which if your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation were ſuch as you in weakneſſe judg, then was not your marriage lawfull as the firſt, then it is not lawfull nor ſanctified to you now, as you judge it is not and then are your Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane: But if your marriage were at firſt lawfull, then your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitations now with your yoke-mates is likewiſe lawfull, and then alſo ſanctified to you now by your beleeving, <hi>elſe were your Children uncleane</hi> (that is) <hi>unlawfully begotten and Baſtards, but now are they holy</hi> (that is) <hi>Legitimate and no Baſtards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this is the genuine ſence of this place may further and clearely appeare by the generall ſcope of the Apoſtle in the 20, 21. 22, 23. <hi>verſes</hi> following in the ſame <hi>Chapter,</hi> where he after he had reſolved the married Beleevers not to depart from their lawfull yoke-mates he then in theſe verſes exhorts Servants and all others, <hi>to abide likewiſe in the lawfull callings wherein they were before their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> and ſeemeth to tell them in effect thus much. That their being converted to the faith did in no wiſe releaſe them from any Lawfull <hi>Covenants</hi> and civill duties in their ſeverall relations
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:155281:7"/>
wherein they ſtood before, but bound them to a more due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all ſuch obligements towards all men, <hi>but in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and worſhip of God, therein they were not to be in ſubjection to any, ſave onely to Ieſus Chriſt, who had therefore bought them with a price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this may likewiſe appeare in <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 14, 15. where the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God by the Prophet ſheweth the reaſons why their offerings were no more accepted, becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>God hath beene witneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and the wife of thy youth (that is his firſt wife then living) againſt whom thou haſt dealt Treacherouſly, yet ſhe is thy companion, and the wife of thy Covenant, and did not he make one, yet had he aboundance of the ſpirit, and wherefore one in that he ſought a Godly or holy ſeed, therefore keepe your ſelves in ſpirit, and let none treſpaſſe againſt the wife of his youth:</hi> In which words it plainely appeareth that the ſcope of the place is, that thoſe Children which are generated by one man and one woman lawfully married, are a godly or holy ſeed, and thoſe that are generated otherwiſe, are not ſo but Baſtards, And the reaſon of this holyneſſe ariſeth not here from any relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had to the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> State, nor from any Church <hi>Covenant,</hi> but meerely from Gods firſt Inſtitution of Marriage in the Creation, and his then providing one woman for one man, and which therefore is of Univerſall concernement to all man-kinde, by the Law of Creation.</p>
            <p>In the ſame ſenſe is the Apoſtle to be taken <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. where he ſaith, <hi>Marriage is Honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled, but</hi> Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers <hi>and</hi> Adulterers <hi>God will judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Marriage be Honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled, then the iſſue of that Bed muſt needs be undefiled (that is) cleane and holy as on the other ſide, the iſſue of all unlawfull conjunctions are uncleane, illegitimate and <hi>Baſtards.</hi> Now this holyneſſe and unholineſſe of Children, proceedeth not from the holineſſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſſe of the Parents: But from the Lawfull or unlawfull conjunction of the Parents in the begetting of their Children, for the Apoſtle in this place ſpeakes of all men Univerſally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It ſeemes then by this, <hi>that the holyneſſe here of the Children ariſeth not from the faith or holineſſe of the Parents, but meerely from the lawfull marriage and conjunction of the Parents in begetting their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is even ſo, for the queſtion or doubt was onely whither they might put away, or depart from their unbeleeving yoke-mates, the which the Apoſtle anſwers, that they ought not to put them away, and he implies this reaſon: Becauſe they were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:155281:8"/>
married unto them according unto Gods ordinance, and this he backs with a double reaſon.</p>

            <p>Secondly, becauſe their Children begotten in that ſtate are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate and holy: on the other ſide, if they were not ſo lawfully married to them, then theſe three concluſions would follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They would not be ſanctified to them.</p>

            <p>Obj. <hi>Why may not then the wife be admitted to</hi> Baptiſme <hi>and Church Fellowſhip with her husband, ſeeing ſhe is made holy by his Beleeving.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not ſo, for ſhe is no otherwiſe ſanctified then Servants, and all other lawfull things are ſanctified to a beleevers uſe: In which ſenſe likewiſe his Cattell and Beaſts are holy and ſanctified, <hi>for to the pure (or Beleever) all lawfull things are pure and holy,</hi> by which reaſon all theſe may as well be admitted, for all theſe are holy in one and the ſame ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But here they object and ſay, Have the Children of Beleevers no more Priviledge then the Children of</hi> Heathen, Turkes <hi>and</hi> Infidels.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I anſwer in reſpect of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Salvtation,</hi> none at all; For this comes not by any naturall Birth, but onely by a new birth of the Spirit, <hi>and the Spirit bloweth where it luſteth,</hi> Jo. 3. 7. 8. <hi>And God is no reſpecter of Perſons:</hi> But in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſſe, is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 34 35. yet notwithſtanding in reſpect of the meanes of Salvation, their priviledge in having beleeving Parents, is farre more then thoſe that have not, for beleeving Parents may be a meanes to bring their Children to the knowledge and faith of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſo be Inſtruments of their Salvation, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here: <hi>The beleeving Husband may ſave his unbeleeving Wife,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The fourth <hi>Scripture</hi> is, That which ſpeakes of <hi>Chriſts</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding little Chrildren to be brought unto him and ſaid, <hi>that of</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:155281:8"/>
               <hi>ſuch is the Kingdome of God,</hi> hence therefore ſome reaſon, <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God belongeth to little Children,</hi> why not the Seales?</p>
            <p>1. To this I anſwer, Firſt that if Infants have right to one of the Seales, (if wee may ſo call them) then to both; to the <hi>Supper</hi> as well as to <hi>Baptiſme:</hi> But here they ſay, not to the <hi>Supper</hi> untill they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to examine themſelves, which is required of all that receive the <hi>Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, ſo Faith and Repentance are required of all that are baptized.</p>
            <p>But here they ſay, that theſe are required onely of men of yeares, not of Infants who are not able to performe them: And the very ſame is my Anſwer in reſpect of the <hi>Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That examination is required onely of men of yeares, and not of Infants who are not able to performe it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if neither my Author nor memory faile mee, Children <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Parker</hi> on the <hi>Croſſe.</hi>
               </note> were admitted as well to the <hi>Supper</hi> as to <hi>Baptiſme</hi> for many yeares in times paſt; And why not as well to the one as to the other, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame reaſons are alike in both, and will center into one if fully proſecuted?</p>
            <p>For as no Infant is required by God in <hi>Scripture</hi> to beleeve or repent, So likewiſe no Infant is required to be baptized, nor is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man any where required by God to baptize an Infant: and the ſame may be ſaid in reſpect of examination, and receiving the <hi>Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer that this reaſon is grounded upon a great miſtake of the ſenſe of the text, for the words are not, unto them belongs the Kingdome, but <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdome,</hi> (that is) of none elſe, but of ſuch, as the next words which follow in theſe texts doe manifeſtly declare, for in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Marke</hi> 10. 15. In both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto mee, for of ſuch is the Kingdome of God.</hi> He preſently confirmes it in the next words thus, <hi>verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdome of God as a little Child, ſhall not enter therein:</hi> As alſo in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 34. Chriſt ſpeaking to his Diſciples ſaith, <hi>Except yee be converted and become as little Children, yee ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, whoſoever therefore ſhall humble himſelfe as this little Child, the ſame is the greateſt in the Kingdome of Heaven:</hi> Whereby it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> his meaning is not of them nor of ſuch as them in age nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20. But of ſuch as them in humility and ſuch like qualifications.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:155281:9"/>
Then they ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> tooke them up in his Armes laid his hands on them and bleſſed them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To which I firſt anſwer, that all this is not baptizing them, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> baptized not, <hi>Io.</hi> 4. 2. And therefore this place ſeemes not at all to prove the baptizing of Infants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, I ſay let them that pleaſe doe as here <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, yet much rather let us all learne the leſſon which <hi>Chriſt</hi> here taught without which wee cannot be ſaved, But wee quite perverting <hi>Chriſts</hi> meaning, do in another ſenſe become li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus it is not onely in theſe <hi>Texts,</hi> but in many more, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that wee through this our Childiſh (if not Brutiſh) follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the heard of Interpreters from humane Authority, rather take many groſſe errors for undenyable Principles, then once open our eyes to ſee and receive the truth upon Gods owne bare word, that wee might beleeve and ſo be ſaved out of this quick Sand of deluſions: And indeed how can wee beleeve, giving and <hi>receiving honour thus one of another, and ſeeke not that honour that cometh of God alone:</hi> As <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells us, <hi>Io.</hi> 12. 44. There be ſome other ſcattering Objections, which I have met withall ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>Object. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 11. 2. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I praiſe you Brethren that you remember me in all things, and keepe the ordinances as I delivered them unto you, whence ſome inferre that ſeeing the Apoſtle calleth them Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces when he delivered them unto the Church, that therefore Ordinances de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not upon the Church: nor upon Office, nor yet upon the Subject: And therefore muſt be eſteemed the Ordinances of</hi> Chriſt <hi>by whomſoever or on whomſoever they are Adminiſtred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that by the Ordinances of <hi>Chriſt</hi> here ſpoken of. wee are onely to underſtand the Commandements of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. or the minde of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as it is revealed in his word) which is all one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. And then the weakneſſe of his objection will preſently diſcover it ſelfe, as wee ſhall ſee if but a little wee open this <hi>Scripture</hi> brought for the countenancing of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the 23. ver. of this <hi>Chap.</hi> telleth the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth: that he delivereth unto them that which he alſo received of the Lord;</hi> and from the 23. unto the 27. <hi>ver.</hi> he relateth what that was which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:155281:9"/>
he had received from the <hi>Lord,</hi> and delivered unto them to obſerve (that is to ſay) <hi>that the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the ſame night in which he was betrayed tooke bread and hen he whad given thanks he brake it; And ſaid, take eate, this is my body which is broken for you: This do yee in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of mee; And after the ſame manner alſo he tooke the Cup when he had ſupped, &amp;c.</hi> And this is one of the Ordinances or Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which in this ſecond verſe the Apoſtle commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and praiſeth the Church for the keeping or doing according as he had delivered unto them, But now contrary hereunto, this <hi>Objection</hi> imports that had but the Idolatrous <hi>Corinthians</hi> taken Bread and Wine &amp; broken it, and devided it amongſt themſelves, nay or which is more groſſe, had they broken and devided the ſame amongſt their dogs and ſwine, yet this ſhould have bin the Ordinance of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if it muſt remaine his by whomſoever or on whomſoever it is adminiſtred<hi>:</hi> But I demand whether the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle received any ſuch Ordinance, or Commandement as this is from Chriſt: or whether he delivered any ſuch thing to the Church, or whether it be any ſuch thing as this which he prayſeth them for keeping and obſerving, or whether this be the Commandement or minde of Chriſt, any where revealed in his word? There is no man ſurely dare ſay ſo, and therefore I do not ſay that this or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch action of any man ſhould nullifie the ordinance or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>Chriſt</hi> before expreſſed, for his word ſtandeth faſt for ever, <hi>And Heaven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, but his word ſhall not faile:</hi> But I deny this to be the minde, the Commandement, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at all, or that ever ſuch a thing came into his heart: And therefore for any to call ſuch actions his Ordinances, can be no leſſe then Blaſphemy againſt the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But they will reply that</hi> Bread <hi>and</hi> Wine <hi>received by any, in ſuch a manner, and Water ſprinkled in the name of the Father &amp;c. Are his Ordinance, and therefore whoſoever hath theſe hath his Ordinance.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that Sheepe and Oxen offered in ſacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, were as much the Lords Ordinance, and therefore <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Sacrifice of Sheepe and Oxen, by this argument muſt needs be the Lords Ordinance, whereas the Lord calleth them the Sacrifice of Devills 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 15. But theſe men it appeares have learned of <hi>King Saul</hi> that if in one particular amongſt many they do but hit of that which the Lord requireth, they like him preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme, that they have performed the Commandement of the Lord, when there is no ſuch matter in the Lords accompt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 3. 13. compared with 11. 19. 23.</p>

See this ſet forth by one familiar Example and ſo I will paſſe this objection; Suppoſe a King for ſome ſpeciall ſervice wherein the honour of Himſelfe and ſafety of His Kingdome is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, ſhould by Commiſſion ordaine or command a Sheriffe upon paine of death, to raiſe for his ſervice tenne thouſand of the moſt able men in his County, and this Sheriffe finding the ſaid number of Children about ſix monthes old (or rather ſo many <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Babies) ſhould preſent them to the King at the very inſtant time of Battaile, as though he had thereby performed the Kings commandement, would this be taken therefore for the Kings Ordinance or appointment delivered to the Sheriffe, It would be little leſſe then death for any man ſo to affirm, yet this is the caſe in hand (but nothing ſo bad) as any man that hath eyes may eaſily diſcerne.</p>
            <p>I inſtance in this example the rather becauſe the Apoſtle doth in divers places reſemble <hi>a Chriſtian to a Souldier,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 3, 4. &amp; 4. 7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 25.

            <p>Object. <hi>It is ſaid,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 1. <hi>of the Children of</hi> Jſrael, <hi>that they were all baptized in the Cloud and in the Sea, there being young Children, as well as men of yeares.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The text is, <hi>That they were all baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Cloud, and in the Sea:</hi> But our queſtion is not of baptizing unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of baptizing unto <hi>Chriſt; by being dipped or buried in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, into the ſimilitude of his death:</hi> according to the Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thus were not theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> baptized, for they were in the Cloud and in the Sea dry, nor was Baptiſme then Inſtituted: thus then is the ſence of the place. That no enjoying of any outward Priviledge, as Baptiſme or the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper; without true faith accompanied with obedience, will now ſave us any more then the many outward Priviledges &amp; viſible ſignes of Gods preſence, and the great outward deliverances which the Lord by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> afforded and wrought for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in bringing them through the Sea; in defending and guiding them in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by the Cloud did exempt and ſave them from Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for notwithſtanding their enjoying all theſe outward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, many of them periſhed in the wilderneſſe for their ſinnes and diſobedience, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſets out as examples unto us, and therefore here by way of alluſion compareth their outward Priviledges, to the outward Priviledges and Ordinances of the

            <p>5. But their fifth and maine argument is yet behinde from the <hi>Covenant</hi> which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with his <hi>ſeed, Gen.</hi> 17. And hence thus they reaſon as the <hi>Covenant</hi> and promiſes were made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> (being a faithfull man) and his ſeed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all his ſeed were circumcized in time of the Law, ſo the ſame <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ized.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that neither <hi>Abraham</hi> nor his ſeed were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcized, becauſe the <hi>Covenant</hi> was made with him: for the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> was made with him above twenty yeares before <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was Inſtituted, as may appeare by comparing <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. 3. and 17. 25. And yet all this time <hi>Abraham</hi> was not circumcized, neither had he or any of his ſeed ever bin circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized for his being in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> had not the Lord afterwards expreſly commanded the ſame: Nor was that <hi>Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed meerely for his being a faithfull man (for then ſhould it have bin made with <hi>Noah</hi> being a faithfull man) but for his being ſuch a faithfull man whom the Lord pleaſed to chuſe and ſet out as a Patterne to all Beleevers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 23, 24. <hi>And to be a Father of many Nations,</hi> Rom. 4. 17, 18. <hi>And in whoſe ſeed all the Nations in the world ſhould be bleſſed,</hi> Act. 5. 25. and 13. 23. (to wit) in <hi>Chriſt</hi> who was to come of his fleſh: And therefore although the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> were made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his <hi>ſeed,</hi> yet the conſequence will not follow, that the <hi>Covenant</hi> is likewiſe made with all Beleevers and their ſeed, for Beleevers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are the ſeed, and the ſeed only, and none of them a Father in the <hi>Goſpell</hi> ſence, nor any other, ſave only <hi>Abraham</hi> to whom and his <hi>ſeed</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> are made, wherefore to affirme that every Beleever hath now the ſame <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> made to <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>ſeed,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> had to him &amp; his <hi>ſeed,</hi> is very abſurd: and is all one as to ſay, that now every Beleever by his beleeving doth immediately become a father of the faithfull as well as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> And if ſo, I demand then where are any <hi>ſeed,</hi> if all be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; For their <hi>ſeed</hi> and their <hi>ſeeds ſeed</hi> are all members of the Church, and to be accounted faithfull, and ſo to be all Fathers of the faithfull as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> from Generation to Generation to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>Or more plainely thus (promiſing onely this truth that there is now no difference betweene any <hi>Circumciſion</hi> or <hi>Vncircumciſion, Iew</hi>

or <hi>Gentile, bond</hi> or <hi>free, Male</hi> or <hi>Female:</hi> But all are one in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> Gal. 3. 28.) I thus expreſſe my ſelfe, if every beleever by his beleeving doth become a father of the faithfull as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> then it muſt be at the very inſtant of his beleeving that he doth become a father of the faithfull as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and if ſo, where then will be any Children to all theſe Fathers, for none can be Children before they be faithfull, and alſo at the ſame inſtant ceaſe to be Children and become Fathers, which implies a flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and then how can <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe <hi>be father of all Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:</hi> Rom. 4 11, 12.</p>

Now then if the <hi>Promiſe</hi> be ſure unto all the <hi>ſeed</hi> unto whom it is made, and all Beleevers, and onely all Beleevers, the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is ſure to: Then all Beleevers and onely all Beleevers are the <hi>ſeed</hi> unto whom the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is made, and then none of <hi>Abrahams</hi> owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <hi>ſeed,</hi> nor the naturall <hi>ſeed</hi> of any other in the world, are to be accounted the <hi>ſeed</hi> unto whom the <hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> is made untill they beleeve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7. 9. This then being a moſt evident truth, it may in no wiſe be granted that the <hi>Covenant</hi> is made with all Beleevers as with <hi>Abraham,</hi> or that the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is made unto all theſe as unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> or that all theſe are fathers as <hi>Abraham,</hi> for all theſe are the <hi>ſeed</hi> and the onely <hi>ſeed</hi> and Children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And thoſe to whom the <hi>Covena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But put caſe it be granted them to be fathers as they deſire to be like to <hi>Abraham</hi> then muſt they be fathers of only ſuch as beleeve, and not untill they beleeve, for according to the Tennor of this New <hi>Covenant</hi> and in the Goſpell ſenſe, <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe is father of none other, nor otherwiſe: And then are they Fathers of their owne Children no otherwiſe then they are fathers of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> Children, which is when they beleeve and not before, and then let them baptize all ſuch their Children warrantably.</p>

            </p>
            <p>They further reaſon from the equity of <hi>Circumciſion</hi> thus: As Infants then by Gods allowance, received that Seale of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> ſo by proportion why not this now of <hi>Baptiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, God commanded <hi>Abraham to circumciſe all the Males in his Houſe, and every Male Child at eight dayes old, as well he that was borne in his Houſe, as he that was bought with money of any ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that is not of his ſeed:</hi> Now it was both right and equall that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> ſhould do herein as God had commanded him, and it had bin ſinfull for him to have done otherwiſe, more or leſſe: And ſo likewiſe it is right for us to do as God hath commanded us to do, and no otherwiſe; The queſtion then is, where the Inſtitution for the baptizing of Infants is? If they ſay that to <hi>Abraham:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that was to circumciſe, not to baptize, that all his Males, not his Females, that all borne in his houſe, or bought with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, at eight dayes old. If they ground it from this Inſtitution, then muſt they obſerve it in every thing, for ſo did <hi>Abraham,</hi> who had ſinned in doing otherwiſe in any thing.</p>
            <p>But here ſay they, we have another Inſtitution to Baptize all Nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, then ought they to obſerve that Inſtitution, which is firſt <hi>to make Diſciples, and then to Baptize them ſo made:</hi> For ſo is the Inſtitution, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But here they ſay, it is not any where forbidden to Baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:155281:12"/>
To which I anſwer, that it is as much forbiden as it was forbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumciſe his Females, for it is not ſaid to him, thou ſhalt not circumciſe thy Females nor thou ſhalt not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any other, ſave ſuch and ſuch, nor onely theſe and theſe: And whoſoever therefore was not included in the Inſtitution, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, for elſe might <hi>Abraham</hi> lawfully have circumciſed alſo all the Males of his Beaſts, as his <hi>Camells</hi> and <hi>Aſſes,</hi> for this is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe forbidden him.</p>
            <p>They further ſay, That Infants now being as capable of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi> with all its ſignifications, as Infants then were of <hi>Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> they ſee no reaſon but they may as well be Baptized as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were circumciſed.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, if they meane by capable Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which is required of every meete Subject (as before was ſhewed) in this ſenſe they are not capable, but if they meane al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be Infants, yet they may be baptized in water, and are as capable to indure it as Infants then were to be circumciſed.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, and ſay, that ſo are all Infants in the world capable of <hi>Baptiſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and ſo all Infants from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> were capable of <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> I demand of them why theſe were not circumcized, they will ſay, becauſe <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was not then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but as ſoone as it was commanded it was done; Then muſt wee baptize Infants when wee are commanded to do it, and not before<hi>:</hi> Notwithſtanding their being thus capable thereof, with all its ſignificationss</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>God gave to Infants Circumciſion, which was a ſigne and ſeale of the Righteouſneſſe of Faith and Regeneration,</hi> Gen. 17 11. Rom. 4. 11. <hi>And wee know God giveth no lying ſigne, nor ſealeth a Covenant to any Perſons that are not therein, Therefore Infants are in the Covenant, have Faith and Regeneration, and ſo ought to be baptized now, as well as circumciſed then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true that God giveth no lying ſigne, nor ſealeth to any perſons that they are in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> when they are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: And therefore ſeeing that <hi>Iſmael</hi> was Circumciſed after that God had declared and made it knowne that he was not in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Gen</hi> 17. 18. 19, 20, 21. It muſt thence follow that <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion</hi> was not by God ordained, nor by <hi>Abraham</hi> underſtood to be to the perſons circumciſed, a ſeale of their being in the <hi>Covenant:</hi> and much leſſe of their being in the Faith or Regenerated; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. which this Objection is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon, of neceſſity muſt be underſtood as the Apoſtle there

applyeth it (to wit) that the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> received both upon himſelfe and ſeed, <hi>was to him and them a ſigne, and Seale, that Righteouſneſſe ſhould be,</hi> (not by the Law or <hi>Circumciſion</hi> in the fleſh) <hi>but by the Faith which</hi> Abraham <hi>had when he was yet uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed:</hi> That <hi>He ſhould be the Father of all thoſe of many Nations, which ſhould afterwards b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that all theſe are, and were to be the only heires and true feed to whom the everlaſting Covenant and Promiſes of life are aſſuredly made, and do properly and undoubtedly appertaine,</hi> ver. 3. 11, 12, 13, 14. 16, 17. 18. 22, 23, 24.

            <p>They yet further ſay, that Infants were then members of the Church, and do demand when they were caſt out.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that they were caſt out when the <hi>Iewes</hi> Church State and old <hi>Covenant</hi> was abrogated by the comming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and preaching of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and planting other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, farre different from that of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in many reſpects: That conſtituted upon nature, and the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grace and the ſpirituall ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> That therefore ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh and of the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> of the fleſh this <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the Spirit and of the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> of the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11.

               <hi>yee are of your father the Divell, and the luſts of your father yee will doe:</hi> As if Chriſt ſhould have reaſoned with the <hi>Iewes</hi> thus; it is true, yee are indeed the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by that your naturall birth and circumciſion of your fleſh, yee were admitted free, and did abide as Members of Gods Church or Houſe in that State under the old Covenant, or law, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> being a ſervant, was the Mediator, which ſtate was but a ſtate of bondage, for <hi>Abrahams</hi> nature could produce no other but ſervants of ſinne, ſuch as your ſelves are, and ſuch muſt not abide in the houſe for ever, nor ſtay therein any longer, but muſt be caſt out; for I am now come to aboliſh that old and firſt Covenant, and to eſtabliſh a better new and ſecond Covenant, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 18. 19. and 8. 13. and 10. 9. whereof I my ſelfe being the Sonne, am the Mediator. If therefore yee will be free indeed, and be made ſubjects of this Covenant and State which I am now to ſet up, your naturall birth ſerves not to admit you, but you muſt be borne a new of the ſpirit and ſo by faith become the true ſeed and heires of the promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7. 29. without which yee cannot be admitted into this State; <hi>for the promiſes were made to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed, not to ſeeds as of many, but to ſeed as of one, which is my ſelfe,</hi> Gal. 3. 16. If therefore I make you free, yee ſhall be free indeed, and then you ſhall abide in the houſe for ever, <hi>being made ſonnes of God by faith in mee,</hi> Gal. 3. 26. <hi>For the promiſe that</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhould be heire of the world was not to him, or to his ſeed by nature, or through the law, but through the righteouſneſſe of faith; for if they</hi> (you <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh) <hi>that are of the Law be heires, then faith is void, and the promſe is made of none effect,</hi> Rom. 4. 13. 14.

            <p>Now then, to ſhut up all, put caſe it be granted (which is not true) that all the children of Believers are thoſe, to whom the promiſe belongeth, are within the Covenant, are elected, yea, and had faith alſo, yet notwithſtanding can they not warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be baptized untill they doe manifeſt and declare the ſame by profeſſion; this is apparent by the doctrine and practice: firſt of <hi>Iohn, Matth.</hi> 3. 6. 8 9. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 4. Secondly, of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 22. compared with 4. 1. 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. 41. and 8. 12. 36. 37. and thirdly, by the tenor of the Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 29. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15. 16.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By this we may partly ſee the groſſe miſtake of all ſuch great <hi>Clerks</hi> of our times which confound theſe two Covenants of Law and Goſpell, and make them both as one in ſubſtance and different onely in circumſtance, as in adminiſtration, or in degrees, the one more darke, the other more light, &amp;c. whereas indeed, they are no leſſe different then old and new, workes and faith, nature and grace, then the Adminiſtration of condemnation, and the adminiſtration of righteouſneſſe, or than the letter killing, and the ſpirit giving life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. 7, 8, 9. or than a ſtate of bondage, and a ſtate of ſonnes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 21. &amp;c. And from hence this errour comes, that in their teachings and writings they make ſuch a kinde of hodge podge of the doctrine of the Goſpell, and ſo intermix Grace and Workes. Truth and Error, and diſtill thereby ſuch a ſpirit of giddineſſe into the hearts of their hearers that for the moſt part they walke in a circular maze, or as in a twilight, left between legall terrors and Goſpel hopes, betweene conſolations and conſternations of ſpirit all the dayes of their lives, and never come to find that ſpiritual life brought to light by the glorious Goſpel nor that rtyumphant ſtate of ſon-ſhip and freedome purchaſed them by Jeſus Chriſt, through faith in his blood. The Apoſtle tels the Church of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> Chap. 6. 14. <hi>That ſinne ſhould not have dominion over them,</hi> the reaſon hee addes, <hi>becauſe they were not under the Law, but under grace,</hi> whence it is evident,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:155281:15"/>
to be under the Law is to be under the dominion of ſinne, and conſequently of death. Now therefore by how much any by their teachings doe confound Law and Goſpell, by ſo much they ſeeke to bring us or rather deteine us in Bondage to ſinne.</p>
            <p>And hence alſo followes that groſſe error of admitting of Infants, and a naturall ſeed, as right Subjects of <hi>Paptiſme</hi> and of the Goſpell Priviledges. Theſe two errors like <hi>Hypocrites</hi> Twynnes ſmile and weep, ſtand and fall together: For if the doctrine of free grace by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> in its native luſter were once diſtinctly ſet out; and the Spirituality thereof in its full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Beauty and glory clearely laid open, It would then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appeare to all men, that none ought to partake of ſuch a ſpirituall eſtate and worſhip without being made ſutable thereunto by Regeneration manifeſted by their Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>But how ſutable ſuch Spirituall worſhip and Churches would be to a Prieſtly Levitical gay Clergy let the wiſe judge: I cannot but much ſuſpect that they do finde farre more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and reliſh in their revenewes of hundreds <hi>per annum</hi> gleabes, tithes &amp;c. Though it be from the world in a Church, then they have hopes to finde in any thing from any ſuch Church in the world.</p>
            <p>I conceive therefore that there is no more hope to ſee that Tribe ſtoope ſo low or forget themſelves ſo much as to owne and beare witneſſe to this truth, then there is to ſee them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Doctrine and Practiſe of bleſſed Saint <hi>Paul: Act.</hi> 20. 17. 34, 35. to be now of uſe and immitation in our times, or then to allow the ſpeeches of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Mar. 12. 38, 39, 40. Luk. 11. 44. 52. Mat. 15. 14. To appertaine aſwell to the Clergy of this Age as to them of any former age; yea, and aſwell as to the learned Scribes, &amp;c. of whom they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to prevaile with theſe men in this point, there is yet one Argument onely wanting (to wit) certaine revenews of 3. 4. or 500. <hi>per annum,</hi> for each of them, with which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (I doubt not) But one might convince the Judgements of a hundred in one day, eaſier then a hundred can one in a whole yeare without it: So prevalent is the world with our corrupt natures, as by dayly experience is ſeene; But theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are of the earth, earthly, and ſutable to earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which men ought to mortifie: and to have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation

            <p>Againe, That adminiſtration of Baptiſme which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes the very nature of the Covenant of Grace and whole Goſpell of Chriſts is Antichriſtian and abominable. But the adminiſtration of baptiſme upon Infants doth ſo, becauſe it ſtands upon the ground and intereſt which they have in the Covenant, (by naturall generation onely, or by the meere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith in the Parents or Sureties) without faith in their owne perſons, <hi>whereby faith is made void, and the promiſe</hi> (which is the Goſpel and Object of Faith) <hi>is alſo made of none effect,</hi> and ſo the preaching thereof, becomes uſeleſſe and vaine alſo, <hi>Rom</hi> 4. 14. therefore the adminiſtration of Baptiſme upon Infants is Antichriſtian and abominable.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſo, it is moſt certaine, that the baptiſme of Infants is the greateſt deluſion, and a thing of as dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as ever the Man of Sin brought into the world; and therefore the greateſt maintainers thereof, are juſtly to be eſteemed the greateſt deluders, wherefore it is high time for us to looke about us to awake out of this drunken ſlumber, and to ſee how hitherto wee and our fathers have beene blindly lead by our blind Guides into this depth of Ignorance and miſt of iniquity, and let us ſeeke out by what meanes, and by whom wee are ſo miſerably intoſticated, as to ſtumble and grope for our way thus even at noone day.</p>
